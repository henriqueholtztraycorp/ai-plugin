## Optional MCP Servers

Only `chrome-devtools` is bundled in `.mcp.json` (required by the `web-performance-audit` skill). The servers below are **suggestions** — agents and skills can take advantage of them when present, but this plugin does **not** auto-install them. Add any you want to your own MCP config.

| Server | Suggested for | Install |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `context7` | `wake-performance-engineer`, `wake-security-auditor` (research, OWASP/CWE lookup) | `npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp` — requires `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` |
| `sequential-thinking` | `wake-performance-engineer`, `wake-security-auditor` (structured reasoning) | `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking` |
| `github` | repo / issue / PR lookups | `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github` — requires `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` |
| `@playwright/mcp` | E2E browser automation, QA flows | `npx -y @playwright/mcp` *(use the official scoped package — not the unscoped `playwright-mcp`)* |
| `shadcn` | UI component generation | `npx shadcn@latest mcp` |
| `TestSprite` | Test scaffolding | `npx -y testsprite-mcp` |

---

## Tools (Scripts)

| Script | Usage | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **wake-graphql-validate.sh** | `./scripts/wake-graphql-validate.sh <query-file>` | Validate GraphQL query: productId (not handle), attributeSelections, partnerAccessToken. |
| **wake-query-from-reference.sh** | `./scripts/wake-query-from-reference.sh <reference-file>` | Extract headless query pattern from Wake Storefront reference. Outputs mapping notes. |
| **wake-checkout-flow-validator.sh** | `./scripts/wake-checkout-flow-validator.sh <file>` | Verify checkout mutations are called in correct order. |

> **Requires a POSIX shell** (bash + `grep`, `awk`, `tr`, `printf`). On Windows, run them under **Git Bash**, **WSL**, or **MSYS2** — they will not run in PowerShell or `cmd.exe`. PowerShell ports are not currently provided.
